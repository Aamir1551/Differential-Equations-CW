\subsection{Establishing New Equations}
Using our new assumptions, we will now take air resistance, to be proportional to speed.
\\
Again we will split up the model into 2 different cases:
\\ \\
\textbf{Case 1: }Plane Lands with the only force acting is the air resistance, which is proportional to the speed.

\begin{align*}
    F_{net} = -kv &= ma && \text{Using Newtons second Law}
    \\ -kv &= m \frac{dv}{dt}
\end{align*}
%Case 2 is now being done
\textbf{Case 2} - Braking Force has now been applied
\begin{align*}
    F_{net} = -kv - F_b = ma && \text{Using Newtons second Law}
    \\ -kv - F_b = m \frac{dv}{dt}
\end{align*}

The force diagram for this model, is the same as shown in 1.4.3. However, in this model we are taking $R = kv $
