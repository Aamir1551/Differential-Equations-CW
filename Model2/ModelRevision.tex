\subsection{Improving the Model}
The assumption that air resistance is proportional to the speed did show some improvement compared to the initial model. However, although it showed some improvement the RMS is still not appropriate and also the residuals are also quite large for some points. Therefore, this model will need to be revised by relaxing some of the assumptions, so that a better Model can be formed that reduces the RMS to a much more acceptable one.

Using the fact the as the speed of the plane increases, the number of collisions with air particles also increase. However, not only does the number of collisions increase but the time over which the collisions take place decrease, resulting in an increased impulse. This means the impulse acting on the plane and the number of particles that collide also increases as the speed on the plane increases, therefore by changing the assumption that air resistance is proportional to v, by using the assumption $R \propto v^2$ , we will be able to take this idea into account and thus better model the landing of the aeroplane. Therefore, from our new assumptions we now have:

\begin{center}
    $ R \propto v^2 $
    \\$ R = kv^2 $
\end{center}
