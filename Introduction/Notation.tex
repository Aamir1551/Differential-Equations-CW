\subsection{Symbols Used}
Throughout this paper, I will be using symbols to represent certain quantities. This is because, by using symbols and letters instead of names, it will be much easier and concise to represent the differential equations in a much more comprehensible format.

\begin{itemize}
  \item {t} will be used to represent the time at a given moment
  \item {v} will represent the speed at a given point in time
  \item {m} will represent the mass of the plane, which is given to be 120,000kg
  \item {$F_{net}$} will represent the resultant force on the plane at any point in time
  \item {R} will be used to denote the air resistance acting on the plane
  \item $F_b$ will represent the braking force at any point in time
  \item $d_i$ will represent the difference at time $t_i$, between the actual $v_i$ value and the predicted $v_i$ value
  \item $c_i$ will represent the constant of integration for a particular model.
  \item $g$ will represent the acceleration due to gravity, which will be taken to be $9.8ms_{-2}$
\end{itemize}
