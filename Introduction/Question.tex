I will be modelling the landing of an aeroplane by forming differential equations, which will model the velocity of the plane as a function of time, to calculate the minimum length of a runway that the plane needs to land safely. I will then compare the results of the differential equations with actual data and identify the strength and weaknesses of each model. I will try to improve upon each model by making the assumptions more realistic to the situation, however these assumptions I make are crucial, as they are used to simplify the differential equations formed.

The information given about the situation is that the aeroplane has a mass of 120,000kg and once it has touched the runway it is slowed by air resistance and once it has slowed down enough it is then slowed down further by applying a constant braking force.

I will be trying to model the landing using this information, by making a few assumptions and using those assumptions, I will then form a differential equation and solve it to find velocity as a function of time.
