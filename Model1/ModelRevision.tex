\subsection{Improving the Model}
One assumption that was made that had a huge negative impact on the model was that air resistance(R) was taken to be a constant. However, in reality this is not true as air resistance depends upon the speed of an object. This is because the slower an object moves, the less air particles it hits which causes the force of air resistance to decrease as speed decreases. 
Therefore, by taking air resistance to be proportional to speed, i.e there is a linear relationship between the speed and air resistance, I will be able to improve this model.

    $ R \propto v $
    \\$ R = kv $
