\subsection{Mathematical representation of the model}
The landing can be broken down into two different cases, as discussed above.
\\
\textbf{Case 1} - Plane Lands only with the only force acting is the constant air resistance

\begin{align*}
    F_{net} = -k &= ma && \text{By Newtons second Law}
    \\ -k &= m \frac{dv}{dt}
\end{align*}
\textbf{Case 2} - Braking Force has been applied
\begin{align*}
    F_{net} = -k - F_b &= ma && \text{By Newtons second Law}
    \\-k - F_b &= m \frac{dv}{dt}
\end{align*}

The force diagram for this model, is the same as shown in 1.4.3. However, in this model we are taking $R = k$.
