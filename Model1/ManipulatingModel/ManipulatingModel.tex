\subsection{Solving the DE}
We can solve these differential equation through separation of variables:

\textbf{Case 1: }
From 1 we have:

\begin{align*}
    -k &= m \frac{dv}{dt}
    \\ \int -k dt &= \int m dv
    \\ -kt &= mv + c_1
    \\ \Aboxed{v &= \frac{-kt - c_1}{m}}
\end{align*}

\textbf{Case 2:}
From 2 we have: 

\begin{align*}
    -k - F_b &= m \frac{dv}{dt}
    \\ \int -k - F_bdt &= \int mdv
    \\ -kt - F_b &= mv + c_2
    \\ \Aboxed{v &= \frac{-kt-F_bt-c_2}{m}}
\end{align*}

\subsection{Justification of parameters chosen}
After carefully examining the data, I have chosen that the brakes were applied when t=9s. I choose t=9s to be the time when the brakes were applied as the gradient of the graph seems to decrease drastically after t=9, and this can easily be observed from the change of shape from the graph. From this we can deduce that the initial conditions are:
%Draw graph to show the gradient decreases rapidly after t=10
\\ \\
\textbf{Case 1: } t = 0s, v = 96ms\textsuperscript{-1} and t=9s, v=55ms \textsuperscript{-1}
\\
\textbf{Case 2: } t = 9s, v = 55ms\textsuperscript{-1} and t=26s, v=0ms \textsuperscript{-1}
\\ \\
So using this, we can see that the first model will give us a function of velocity from 0 to 9s, and model 2 will give us a function of velocity that will model the velocity from 9s until the aeroplane comes to a complete stop, which is at t=26s. Both models use the point (t=9, v=55), as not using this point would result in the graph being discontinuous, and thus not an accurate model of what is happening. Also, having a continuous graph is necessary as it will be crucial when finding the area under the graph in order to find the length of the runway required for the aeroplane.

\subsection{Solutions of the DE}
\textbf{Case1: } 
Using the initial conditions, we can find v as a function of t
\\ \\
Using the point (t=0, v=96), we see that:
\begin{center}
\begin{align*}
    v &= \frac{-kt - c_1}{m}
    \\ 96 &= \frac{-c_1}{m}
    \\ \d c_1 &= -96m
\end{align*}
\end{center}
Using the point (t=9, v=55), we see that:
\begin{center}
\begin{align*}
    v &= \frac{-kt - c_1}{m}
    \\ 55 &= \frac{-9k+96m}{m}
    \\ 55m &= -9k + 96
    \\ 9k &= 41m
    \\ k &= \frac{41}{9}m
    \\ &= 4.56m
\end{align*}
\end{center}

From this we can deduce that for case 1:

\begin{equation}
    \boxed{v = -4.56t + 96}
\end{equation}

\textbf{Case 2: } 
Using the initial conditions, we can find v as a function of t
\\ \\
Using the point (t=9, v=55), we see that:
\begin{center}
\begin{align*}
    v &= \frac{-kt-F_bt-c_2}{m}
    \\ v &= -\frac{-41t}{9}t - \frac{F_bt - c_2}{m}
    \\ 55 &= -41 - \frac{9F_b}{m} -\frac{c}{m}
    \\ 96 &= -\frac{9F_b}{m} - \frac{c_2}{m}
\end{align*}
\end{center}
Using the point (t=26, v=0), we see that:
\begin{center}
\begin{align*}
    v &= \frac{-kt-F_bt-c_2}{m}
    \\ v &= -\frac{-41t}{9} - \frac{F_bt - c_2}{m}
    \\ 0 &= -\frac{1066t}{9} - \frac{26F_b}{m} -\frac{c_2}{m}
\end{align*}
\end{center}
\begin{equation}
     \frac{1066m}{9} = -26F_b - c_2
\end{equation}

Therefore by solving the simultaneous equation we find:
\begin{align*}
    F_b &= -\frac{8080000}{51}
    \\ &= -158431.3725
    \\ c_2 &= -\frac{171600000}{17}
    \\ &= -10094117.65
\end{align*}

Therefore we can conclude that for case 2:
\begin{equation}
    \boxed{v = -3.24t + 84.1}
\end{equation}
