\subsection{Comparison}
Clearly, the initial model does not fit the data given. Using the assumption that air resistance is constant produced a straight line graph, which does not suit the data very well as it clearly does not lie on a straight line. Moreover, using the assumption that air resistance is constant, also led to the braking force being negative, making this model seem like a very unrealistic. Finally, the RMS error is also very high as it is 3.74, which also gives further evidence that this model needs to be improved by relaxing some the assumptions made.
