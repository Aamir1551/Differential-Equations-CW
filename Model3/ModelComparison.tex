\subsection{Comparison}
This much more improved model, shows a significant improvement, which can easily be seen by the graph. The RMS error for model 3 is 0.133, which is much less than the RMS error for model 2 which happened to be 1.78. In addition, to the decreased RMS error, all the residuals have decreased and are all less than 1, meaning that the model fits well with the data given.
