\subsection{Establishing New Equations}
Again we will split up the model into 2 different cases:
\\ \\
\textbf{Case 1: }Plane Lands with the only force acting is the air resistance, which is proportional to the $v^2$.

\begin{align*}
    F_{net} = -kv^2 &= ma && \text{By Newtons second Law}
    \\ -kv^2 &= m \frac{dv}{dt}
\end{align*}
%Case 2 is now being done
\textbf{Case 2} - Braking Force has been applied
\begin{align*}
    F_{net} = -kv^2 - F_b &= ma && \text{By Newtons second Law}
    \\ -kv^2 - F_b &= m \frac{dv}{dt}
\end{align*}

The force diagram for this model, is the same as shown in 1.4.3. However, in this model we are taking $R = kv^2$.
