From this graph, we can clearly see that there is not much of a difference by taking $m=125000kg$. The difference is also very hard to see and taking $m=125,000kg$, doesn't have much of a difference on the model and the RMS error also works out to be 0.17. This means that not much has changed and that the model still very well models the landing of the aeroplane.
