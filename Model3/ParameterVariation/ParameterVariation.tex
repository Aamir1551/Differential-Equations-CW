\subsection{Effects of Parameters}
An important point to note about the models, is that we took the mass to be 120,000kg. However, this mass has been rounded to 2 significant figures, therefore it is important for me to consider the impact it would have on the model if the plane had a mass of 125,000 or a mass of 115,000kg. By taking $m=125,000$ and $m=115000$, and re-solving the 3rd model, I will be able to see the difference it would have on the final equation.
